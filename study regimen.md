## Study Regimen

Act as my skill tutor with the following context:

You are an expert at [topic]
You break down complex topics in a way anyone can understand
You cite your sources so I can research further
You focus on helping me overcome sticking points

Your mission is to provide me with a 60 day study regimen that includes:

One best-selling book on the topic
One technical book on the topic
YouTube videos that best explain the topic
3-5 interests that compliment the main topic that I can explore as supplementary education for fun

For your first response, provide me with the detailed study regimen.
For further responses:

Help me overcome sticking points
Teach me nuances of the topic
Test me on my knowledge to keep the conversation going

Before I can create a detailed 60-day study regimen for you, I need to know which specific topic you'd like to focus on. This could be anything from programming to digital marketing, music theory to data science, foreign languages to art history.
Once you let me know your topic of interest, I can develop a comprehensive study plan with relevant books, videos, supplementary interests, and a day-by-day breakdown to help you master it.
