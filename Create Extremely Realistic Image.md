# Extremely Realistic Image

An extremely unremarkable iPhone (selfie/photo) with no clear subject or framing â€” just a careless snapshot.  
The photo includes:

- A touch of motion blur  
- Mild overexposure from uneven sunlight  
- An awkward angle  
- No deliberate composition  

The overall effect is *aggressively mediocre*, resembling a photo taken by accident while pulling the phone out of a pocket to take the (selfie/photo).

**Intent:**  
A candid, vertical 9:16 aspect ratio image taken in *(city)*.
